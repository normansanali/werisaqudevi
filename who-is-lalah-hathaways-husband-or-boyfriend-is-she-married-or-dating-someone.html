Blige, The Winans, Take 6, Marcus Miller, Donald Lawrence, Nona Hendryx, Sandra St. Victor, Joyce Kennedy, Will Downing, and Gerald Albright Simone deserves among other things.&nbsp;She was also featured on Israel and New Breed’s 2006 Christmas album,&nbsp;</span><i><span>A Christmas Ever Timeless.</span></i></p><p><span>Aside from music, Lalah Hathaway is a breast cancer activist.&nbsp;She is one of the National Ambassadors for the Circle of Promise, a campaign launched by Susan G. Komen in October 2007.&nbsp;The campaign aims to heal, educate, empower and mobilize the African American community in the fight against breast cancer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Married or married, who is Lalah Hathaway’s husband/boyfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Now for the big question.&nbsp;But no way!&nbsp;Nobody gets Lalah Hathaway to talk about her relationships – boyfriend, husband, kids and all that stuff.&nbsp;Never!&nbsp;Journalists have tried several times, but Lalah’s usual response has always been, “No comment.”&nbsp;And so no one knows if Lalah has ever been married or not, if she has dated before or is currently dating someone.&nbsp;Nobody can tell.</span></p><p><span>However, rumor spread that Lalah had spotted engagement rings with a man believed to be her boyfriend.&nbsp;The pair were reportedly eyeing some expensive diamond rings at some jewelry stores.&nbsp;Well, we’ll pay attention and see what becomes of the story.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMpZilmZhitaLAx5qumrGjYrW2v8GapZ1ln6d6o7vYn6minZ6Zeqq%2FjKyfnmWdlr%2BztcSdZKiqXZmutbXNoGSsp52avK%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-lalah-hathaways-husband-or-boyfriend-is-she-married-or-dating-someone.html&text=Who%20is%20Lalah%20Hathaways%20husband%20or%20boyfriend%3fIs%20she%20married%20or%20dating%20someone%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-lalah-hathaways-husband-or-boyfriend-is-she-married-or-dating-someone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-lalah-hathaways-husband-or-boyfriend-is-she-married-or-dating-someone.html&title=Who%20is%20Lalah%20Hathaways%20husband%20or%20boyfriend%3fIs%20she%20married%20or%20dating%20someone%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-lalah-hathaways-husband-or-boyfriend-is-she-married-or-dating-someone.html&title=Who%20is%20Lalah%20Hathaways%20husband%20or%20boyfriend%3fIs%20she%20married%20or%20dating%20someone%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-lalah-hathaways-husband-or-boyfriend-is-she-married-or-dating-someone.html&title=Who%20is%20Lalah%20Hathaways%20husband%20or%20boyfriend%3fIs%20she%20married%20or%20dating%20someone%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-lalah-hathaways-husband-or-boyfriend-is-she-married-or-dating-someone.html&description=Who%20is%20Lalah%20Hathaways%20husband%20or%20boyfriend%3fIs%20she%20married%20or%20dating%20someone%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-was-mahsa-amini-age-video-family-wiki-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who was Mahsa Amini?
