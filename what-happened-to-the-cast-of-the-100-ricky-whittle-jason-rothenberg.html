As a result, some people seem to think that viewers only care about superhero content these days. In reality, however, anyone who pays attention will know that <a href=#>the top teen dramas</a> inspire a lot of passion in their viewers, to save the very least. For example, fans of the young adult teen drama The 100 care deeply about the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Shawn Mendes' Role In 'The 100'</a></span></p><p>As a result of the fact that The 100 had an extremely loyal fan base, there has been a lot of interest in what went on behind the scenes. The perfect example of that is the fact that fans were really interested in who the series’ stars were involved with, especially when <a href=#>The 100 stars dated each other</a>. Unfortunately, however, some behind-the-scenes facts about The 100 are really negative. Most notably, one of The 100’s stars has admitted that they hated working on the show due to the showrunners’ “disgusting” behavior.</p><h2 id=the-100-rsquo-s-showrunner-has-been-under-fire-in-the-past>The 100’s Showrunner Has Been Under Fire In The Past</h2><p>Throughout television history, there haven’t been many LGBTQ+ characters who were given a prominent role. Sadly, on the rare occasion when one of those characters was put in a prominent position, many of them went on to exit their shows after they lost their lives out of nowhere. As a result, people who’ve noticed this disturbing trend have derisively labeled the trope, bury the gay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Best LGBTQ Characters On TV (And 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for The 100 fans, Alycia Debnam-Carey decided to leave her role after starring in the show from 2014 until 2016. As a result, the show’s writers and showrunners had to figure out how to best handle her character Lexa’s exit.</p><p>Given the fact that Lexa was very popular and viewers were very interested in the romantic relationship she had with a female character named Clarke, people wanted her to have a fitting ending. Instead, as soon as she consummated her relationship with Clarke, she was killed by someone who disapproved of the couple’s relationship. Since that is a perfect example of the bury the gay trope, a lot of people were furious and after handling that backlash poorly at first, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 100’s showrunner eventually apologized for Lexa’s exit</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ricky-whittle-called-the-100-rsquo-s-showrunner-jason-rothenberg-rsquo-s-conduct-ldquo-disgusting-rdquo>Ricky Whittle Called The 100’s Showrunner Jason Rothenberg’s Conduct “Disgusting”</h2><p>In the past, actors who’ve been mistreated have felt like there was no way for them to speak out and remain employable which was a revolting situation. As a result, a lot of actors have put up with abusive behavior and that is especially true when it comes to women. Thanks to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, however, a lot of <a href=#>really bad people have been brought to justice</a>. The reason for that is that some victims who’ve spoken out about the abuse they’ve dealt with have been supported and taken seriously.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Celebrities That Have Gotten Caught In The #MeToo Scandal</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, before the #MeToo moment really took hold, a lot of accusations were largely ignored. For that reason, a lot of people don’t know that shortly after he quit the show, The 100’s Ricky Whittle revealed that he quit the show. After his mom alluded to Ricky being mistreated on Twitter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whittle detailed his claims against The 100’s showrunner Jason Rothenberg</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was my choice to go. Jason Rothenberg abused his position to make my job untenable. What he did was disgusting and he should be ashamed. A lot was made of what my mom said all over Twitter, but everything she said was true. He was professionally bullying me, cutting out all the storyline I was supposed to be doing, cutting lines, cutting everything out, trying to make my character and myself as insignificant as possible.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Every time a script would come through I would see literally nothing for Lincoln,” he said. “He’s not doing anything. It was never about screen time, it’s an ensemble cast … but it was why he had no screen time. I approached other producers [on set] and said, ‘What’s going on?’ because Jason always stayed in Santa Monica. ‘Why am I being treated like this?’ And the producer I spoke to just [said], ‘You need to speak to him. I don’t know what his problems are with you.’”</p><p>After detailing his complaints against Jason Rothenberg, Ricky Whittle went on to explain that after he decided to quit, his character was initially going to have a fitting. Then, at the final second changes were made so his character had a poor exit which made him feel like the change was made out of spite. “It kind of seemed settled that Lincoln was going to go toward the end of the season, and then a script came out and an amendment came out … where he went back and was executed. I mean, even that storyline — he was executed for no reason. It was very weak.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Murphy From ‘The 100’s’ Real-Life Relationship With His Co-Star</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDHnmScmaOperCyjK2fnmVhZX1uvsicorJlp522tcDLnmSjmaOku26%2Bzq2fnqaSmr%2Boew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-100-ricky-whittle-jason-rothenberg.html&text=This%20%27100%27%20Star%20Hated%20Working%20On%20The%20Show%20Due%20To%20His%20Boss%20Disgusting%20Conduct&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-100-ricky-whittle-jason-rothenberg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-100-ricky-whittle-jason-rothenberg.html&title=This%20%27100%27%20Star%20Hated%20Working%20On%20The%20Show%20Due%20To%20His%20Boss%20Disgusting%20Conduct" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-100-ricky-whittle-jason-rothenberg.html&title=This%20%27100%27%20Star%20Hated%20Working%20On%20The%20Show%20Due%20To%20His%20Boss%20Disgusting%20Conduct" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-100-ricky-whittle-jason-rothenberg.html&title=This%20%27100%27%20Star%20Hated%20Working%20On%20The%20Show%20Due%20To%20His%20Boss%20Disgusting%20Conduct" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-100-ricky-whittle-jason-rothenberg.html&description=This%20%27100%27%20Star%20Hated%20Working%20On%20The%20Show%20Due%20To%20His%20Boss%20Disgusting%20Conduct" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vanacc-sofa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikTok Famous Couch is Available on Amazon">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-untold-truth-of-alicia-witt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Untold Truth Of Alicia Witt">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
