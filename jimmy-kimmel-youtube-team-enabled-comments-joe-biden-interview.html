Heading into the conversation,<strong> Biden was already receiving heat for his lack of appearances on talk shows during his run as President</strong>, which was unlike past Presidents such as Barack Obama, and even Donald Trump.</p><p>Of course, the conversation was politically motivated, and touched on several different issues in the US at the time. A couple of years later, most are still worth discussing.</p><p>A summary of Biden and Kimmel's interview:</p><ul><li>School shooting in America,</li><li>Passing an Executive Order.</li><li>Strides in climate change.</li><li>Joe Manchin & Kyrsten Sinema,</li><li>Rising food and gas prices.</li><li>Negative impact of the pandemic.</li><li>Mental Health Care.</li><li>Changes in the press.</li><li>Hope for the US.</li></ul><p>The lengthy interview certainly was diverse. However, the outcome was not a positive one. <strong>Generally, fans felt as though the President was all over the place throughout the interview</strong>. In addition, the majority of viewers could not believe that Kimmel's YouTube team left comments open. <strong>A near 48K wrote in, and the most liked comments were anything but positive.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>What were the most liked comments saying?</strong></p><ul><li>"Heartwarming to read the comments and see that the public is not buying the BS."</li><li>"Props for having the guts to leave the comments section enabled.

Kimmel looked extra bubbly throughout the interview as the adult star detailed her time with Donald Trump. “I’m pretty sure I thought he was channeling Hugh Hefner,” said Daniels upon entering Trump's hotel room. "Significantly less sexy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike her first time on the show, Daniels was very open this time around.

However, the fan reaction was limited as <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel's YouTube team wisely turned off the comments</a>. In all likelihood, that was done to protect Stormy Daniels from the backlash.
