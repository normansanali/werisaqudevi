Models and has modeled for brands such as Gucci and Zara, appearing on the cover of Maxim.<br>• She dated Russian-American YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetsky for several years before their split in the second half of 2017.<br>• Her estimated net worth is over $500,000.</p>﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h2><span id=Who_is_Bri_Teresi_Maxim_model_and_Snapchat_star_Wiki_Bio>Who is Bri Teresi, Maxim model and Snapchat star? Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Bri Teresi was born in Auburn, Alabama USA, on 8 October 1994 – her zodiac sign is Libra and she holds American nationality. She is a model, Instagram celebrity, and a Snapchat star, who is mostly famous for the pictures she uploads onto her Instagram and Snapchat accounts.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Bri was raised an only child in Auburn in a middle-class family – her father is a salesman while her mother is working at a local market. She was very active while attending high school, as she played soccer and ran track, and later decided to focus on fitness and started going to the gym as well.</p><p>Upon matriculation, she enrolled at San Jose State University, California, where she studied alongside Richard Ayala, an Instagram star, and the two dated for two years. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political science in 2016, but then decided to focus on her career on the internet, rather than become involved in politics.</p><h2><span id=Career_as_a_model_and_a_Snapchat_Queen>Career as a model and a Snapchat ‘Queen’</span></h2><p>Bri is mostly famous for the career she has on the internet.</p><p>She launched her Snapchat account sometime in the ‘10s, and considers herself to be the ‘Snapchat Queen’ – the platform was created by Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown and Bobby Murphy while they were studying at Stanford University, and is mostly used for sending multimedia messages. It’s popular for its unique style of messaging – after a message or video is sent to another user, it is only visible for around 10 to 15 seconds. Her career as a model was launched after her Instagram account was noticed by a modelling scout, who invited her to attend her first photoshoot.</p><p>She is currently signed to L.A. Models in Los Angeles where she is currently living, and she’s posed for several popular brands such as Gucci and Zara, and has been featured on cover pages of several magazines including “Maxim”.</p><p>Bri is also an <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram star</a>, and her account is followed by nearly 800,000 people; she mostly uploads pictures in which she is wearing lingerie and underwear, and although there are many pictures in which she is topless, she is taking extra care not to violate Instagram’s terms of usage, as her account was once banned for a month.</p><p>She launched her <a rel=nofollow href=#>YouTube channel</a> on 12 June 2016 with Katie Teresi, and even though they planned to upload a new video every day, it seems as they have stopped using their channel, which now counts over 14,000 subscribers.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_boyfriend>Love life and boyfriend</span></h2><p>According to the “GUY KISSES VITALY EX GF BRI TERESI ON A DARE | ICE POSEIDON” video which was uploaded onto YouTube on 13 September 2018, Bri was in a relationship with Vitaly Zdorovetsky, a Russian-American YouTuber, for several years before their split in the second half of 2017.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.org///marriedbiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katie-and-Bri-Teresi-in-Bikini-2016-04-768x1024.jpg></p><p>The two met on the internet, and after chatting for a while met in person to starting their relationship in 2015.</p><p>Vitaly was born in Murmansk, Russia on 8 March 1992 – his zodiac sign is Pisces and he holds both Russian and American nationality. He was raised in Odessa in Ukraine, where he tried to become a professional skateboarder, but after hurting himself badly, he gave up on that dream. He worked as a garbage collector when he was 15 years-old, earning $5 per hour, before switching to work as a sign-spinner making $20 per three hours.</p><p>He then moved to Miami in Florida, USA, where he began working as a bus boy at a local restaurant; at the age of 18, he starred in a pornographic movie. He is popular for his “<a rel=nofollow href=#>VitalyzdTv</a>” YouTube channel, which he launched on 7 August 2011 and which is today subscribed to by over 20 million people, and counts nearly 1.7 billion views combined of all his videos.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_other_interests>Hobbies and other interests</span></h2><p>Bri’s main hobby is travelling and she has been to several USA states and to a couple of European cities such as London – where she is signed to a modelling agency – Berlin in Germany, and Paris in France.</p><p>She is a big lover of animals and has a <a rel=nofollow href=#>pet dog Jack</a> who is occasionally featured in the pictures she uploads onto her Instagram account. She is a shopaholic, and goes shopping for clothes on a daily basis – while her favorite two colors are red and black. She likes watching movies, with her favorite actor and actress being Morgan Freeman and Natalie Portman, while some of her favorite movies are “The Shawshank Redemption”, “Yes Man”, and “V for Vendetta”.</p><p>Bri is physically very active as she has several training sessions at the gym every week, and offers advice on exercising on her Instagram and Snapchat accounts.</p><p>She is also offering lessons for those who are willing to pay for her fitness instructions. She enjoys spending her <a rel=nofollow href=#>free time in nature</a> such as on hills and in parks, and is keen on hiking and camping in the woods.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Bri is 25 years old. She has long blonde hair and blue eyes, is 5ft 7ins (1.7m) tall, and weighs around 136lbs (62kgs). As of early 2020, her net worth is estimated at over $500,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDm6Con6KWvanFjaipoGeSp7ZuwMSrnKyhXaKuubXMZqSonJWheqK6w2aqp5mgmLWiwIysq5qqXay1sHnIrGSsoJVk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbri-teresi-maxim-model-and-snapchat-star-who-is-she.html&text=Bri%20Teresi%20-%20%27Maxim%27%20Model%20and%20Snapchat%20Star&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbri-teresi-maxim-model-and-snapchat-star-who-is-she.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbri-teresi-maxim-model-and-snapchat-star-who-is-she.html&title=Bri%20Teresi%20-%20%27Maxim%27%20Model%20and%20Snapchat%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbri-teresi-maxim-model-and-snapchat-star-who-is-she.html&title=Bri%20Teresi%20-%20%27Maxim%27%20Model%20and%20Snapchat%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbri-teresi-maxim-model-and-snapchat-star-who-is-she.html&title=Bri%20Teresi%20-%20%27Maxim%27%20Model%20and%20Snapchat%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbri-teresi-maxim-model-and-snapchat-star-who-is-she.html&description=Bri%20Teresi%20-%20%27Maxim%27%20Model%20and%20Snapchat%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cristiano-ronaldo-georgina-rodriguez-twins-announcement.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cristiano Ronaldo set to become a twin dad again - see Georgina Rodriguez's pregnancy reveal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./agents-of-shield-brett-dalton-doesnt-get-enough-credit-for-his-marvel-role-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brett Dalton 'Doesn't Get Enough Credit' For His Marvel Role">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
