It includes the Rangoon Bombing of 1983, which was intended to assassinate Chun Doo-hwan, South Korea’s fifth president, in Rangoon (Burma), the defection of Lee Woong-pyung (a North Korean pilot) in 1983, and the Gwangju Massacre of 1980, which was a reaction to the notorious Chun Doo-hwan’s coup d’état that established him as <a href=#>the dictator</a>. With thrills, action, spies, and espionage, ‘Hunt’ ups the ante on anticipation while also making the plot personal by involving two South Korean officers with a terrible past. Lee Jung-Jae directs the film, which stars Lee Jung-Jae, Jung Woo-sung, Go Yoon Jung, and Jeon Hye-jin.
