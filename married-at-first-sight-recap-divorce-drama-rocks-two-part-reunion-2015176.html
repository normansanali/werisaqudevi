The second season of the controversial social experiment concluded on Tuesday, June 16, with a two-hour reunion that checked in on the status of the three couples — <strong>Sean Varricchio</strong> and <strong>Davina Kullar</strong>, <strong>Ryan De Nino</strong> and<strong> Jessica Castro</strong>, and <strong>Ryan Ranellone</strong> and <strong>Jaclyn Methuen</strong>. The pairs were matched together by<strong>&nbsp;Dr. Joseph Cilona</strong>, <strong>Dr. Logan Levkoff</strong>, <strong>Dr. Pepper Schwartz</strong>, and <strong>Greg Epstein</strong>.</p><p>It turned out that love was not in the air this season as all three couples, who met only seconds before marrying each other, announced at the reunion that they have decided to split. The drama was not limited to divorce, though, as the pairs fought over infidelity, distance, and bullying. How exactly did it all go down with each couple? Read on to find out.</p><p><strong>Sean Varricchio and Davina Kullar</strong></p><p>The reunion kicked off with Sean and Davina, the only couple who had already decided to divorce at the six-week mark of their marriage. Things started off ominously for the couple as the wedding picture of them that decorated the set kept falling off the wall. Was it a sign from the universe about how the night was going to go for the two of them?</p><p>Probably, as Davina and Sean were barely civil to one another throughout the reunion. Sean accused Davina of being a bully who demanded that he do exactly as she says, while Davina claimed that Sean came into the experiment with impure intentions and that he was fake throughout the process. The experts were furious with Davina for calling them out on their potential credibility, and asked her to own up to her contributions to the failure of her arranged marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“The experiment didn’t fail you, you failed the experiment!” Dr. Levkoff exclaimed when the couple admitted that they spent only 10 days together throughout their marriage. Sean and Davina both agreed that they possibly could have tried harder, but were ready to cut their losses and move on.</p><p><strong>Ryan De Nino and Jessica Castro</strong></p><p>After Sean and Davina, the reunion moved on to Ryan and Jessica, the couple that has sparked the highest amount of media interest in light of Jessica recently <a href=#>filing a restraining order</a> against her husband. Unsurprisingly, the couple announced right away that they were no longer together.</p><p>Things immediately became tense as the couple argued over the many reasons why it didn’t work out for the two of them. First, Jessica revealed that shortly after the six-week mark of their marriage, Ryan began an affair with another woman. It escalated to the point where Ryan even decided to spend Valentine’s Day with his mistress instead of his wife! Ryan was unhappy with the accusations and asked for a break from host Kevin Frazier. Kevin was unwilling to let him leave the set and that somehow sparked Ryan to accuse Jessica of destroying highly personal items of his out of rage, an accusation Jessica admitted had some basis in truth!</p><p>At this point, Dr. Schwartz claimed that the experts decided to match the two because they both had a “sweetness” in them, and yet their interactions continued to go to a sour place as finances were brought up. The infamous $100 bill that Ryan took from their joint wedding fund was discussed. Jessica remained furious with him for spending their shared money without first consulting her, and Ryan remained enraged because he thought it wasn’t that grievious an error. Things escalated to the point where Jessica dropped a Benjamin in his lap, saying that she was fine with giving it to him because “he needed the money more than” her! Ryan took the money before he stormed off the set.</p><p>The experts were horrified by both Jessica and Ryan, and wondered why they couldn’t communicate effectively with one another, relying instead on cheap provocations and screaming matches. Jessica said that this marriage may have worked if they could have talked to one another, but that it clearly wasn’t happening, and divorce had become the only option for the two of them.</p><p><strong>Ryan Ranellone and Jaclyn Methuen</strong></p><p>The reunion concluded by checking in with the season’s fan-favorite couple, Ryan and Jaclyn. To the experts’ chagrin, Jaclyn and Ryan announced that they, too, have decided to split after six months together. It turned out that Ryan wasn’t ready to fully commit to Jaclyn, especially when it meant leaving his mother and niece behind.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>While Jaclyn described her hurt feelings over the lack of heart Ryan put into the marriage, the experts begged her to consider giving him a second chance. Even the host got in the action, as Kevin told her that marriage was about “the long haul” instead of the short term. Jaclyn seemed less than enthused to giving it another go, but eventually acquiesced to considering the possibility. Maybe there’s hope for love this season after all?</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Were you shocked by the results of Married at First Sight’s second season?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqqKesqV5wK1kn6GiqMFuv8ign61lopqworyMnaCvp6KYsm6w0ZqkmmWipLCsv4ytrqhloJa%2FtXnRnqynoZ%2BjenN8kG5ocG5f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-recap-divorce-drama-rocks-two-part-reunion-2015176.html&text=Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Recap%3a%20Divorce%20Drama%20Rocks%20Two-Part%20Reunion&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-recap-divorce-drama-rocks-two-part-reunion-2015176.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-recap-divorce-drama-rocks-two-part-reunion-2015176.html&title=Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Recap%3a%20Divorce%20Drama%20Rocks%20Two-Part%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-recap-divorce-drama-rocks-two-part-reunion-2015176.html&title=Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Recap%3a%20Divorce%20Drama%20Rocks%20Two-Part%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-recap-divorce-drama-rocks-two-part-reunion-2015176.html&title=Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Recap%3a%20Divorce%20Drama%20Rocks%20Two-Part%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-recap-divorce-drama-rocks-two-part-reunion-2015176.html&description=Married%20at%20First%20Sight%20Recap%3a%20Divorce%20Drama%20Rocks%20Two-Part%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./matty-matheson-biography-wife-wiki-age-net-worth-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matty Matheson  Biography, Wife, Age, Net Worth, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lil-tay-wiki-age-bio-height-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lil Tay (Rap Girl) Height, Age, Boyfriend, Net worth, Biography, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
