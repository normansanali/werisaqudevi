This happens in the first part of Season 2. The second part of Season 2 sees Anna and Steve‚Äôs relationship progress. Then is when Billa‚Äôs character (Steve‚Äôs arguably gross friend) is introduced on the show ‚Äî as along with Maya, Derrick starts tagging along to the couple‚Äôs dates, making these two also become an item.</p><p>While Anna and Steve have real feelings for each other, Derrick has become ‚Äúnaive‚Äù Maya‚Äôs boyfriend for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>So, we can say Derrick goes on to become the most despised character on the show.

A certain media outlet spotted them attending Netflix‚Äôs The Good Cop premiere back in September 2018 and called her Bill‚Äôs wife which is not true.</p><p>In October the same year, Bill took to his Twitter to wish the same Mary on her Birthday, writing ‚Äî ‚ÄúThis is Mary Neely she is very sweet and beautiful. It was her bday in April but we are celebrating it in October and it‚Äôs now her half birthday so it works out!‚Äù</p><p>With that being said, it was unclear if they were/are in a relationship.</p><p>With that being said, let us also share a fact with you, that back in October 2013, he used to date a girlfriend named Marcia Gay Harden.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Bill Kottkamp Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Bill Kottkamp had less than an estimated $200K net worth until December 2021.</p><p>From what it looks like, Bill‚Äôs acting career is just getting started.</p><p>Before Pen15, Bill Kottkamp appeared in a&nbsp;handful of small roles in big productions like Annabelle Comes Home and Fist Fight. He was a ‚ÄúPizza Guy‚Äù in Annabelle Comes Home.</p><p>Meanwhile, IMDB has credited him as an actor and producer known for Annabelle Comes Home (2019), Fist Fight (2017), and Moments of Clarity (2016).</p><p>As a comedian, Bill also came on several episodes of Who Charted! podcasts counting down the Music Chart all the while busting out his best relationship with rhymes and vaudeville jokes.</p><p>Besides, his LinkedIn also says he was inspired to become a business and tech guru at some point in life.</p><p>From 2013 ‚Äì 2016, he studied Improv/Comedy at Accredited Theatre School at Upright Citizens Brigade.</p><h3><strong>Bill Kottkamp Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in the year 1994, Bill Kottkamp likely turned 27 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Bill Kottkamp Family</strong></h3><p>Now and then, Bill Kottkamp tweeted about his parents. However, in those times, he would not reveal much about them but rather mention them during everyday jokes saying something like ‚ÄúMy dad wanted Burger King for his birthday dinner, is he their target demographic? WHO DO THEY APPEAL TO?????‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy mom is pissed I called my dad about my clean teeth first SMDH‚Äù.</p><p>Back in February 2020, when took his family for a rollercoaster ride he shared ‚ÄúMy dad loves rollercoasters but can‚Äôt go on many anymore, I had to make sure he was ok.‚Äù</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Does Bill Kottkamp Celebrate His Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>It is on the 8th of June Bill that celebrates his birthday every year.
