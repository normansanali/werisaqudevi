She had gotten to a steep area without equipment before falling off the ledge.</p><p>At around 4.10 p.m., police received a call informing them about the tragedy faced by McKinney; however, due to a deep cliffy area, it took police hours to reach there.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the police, she had fallen in a far area hence reaching there was a struggle. After reaching her location, the search and rescue teams confirmed that she had died on the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Moab Police Assistant Chief Lex Bell, who knew McKinney, the entire town was devastated by her sudden death.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‘I’ve met her, and she’s pretty well-known in the community.’ </strong>Bell added. <strong>‘It’s incredibly tragic; the timing is even more unfortunate with tonight and what was going to happen.’</strong></p><p>McKinney was scheduled to receive an award from her school, Grand County High School, at halftime of the varsity basketball game that evening.&nbsp;</p><p>Since everyone in Moab and Grand County knew one another, the assistant police chief claimed McKinney had a sizable family and friend base.</p><p>The incident has left the <a href=#>community</a> heartbroken and struggling to come to terms with her sudden loss.</p><p>McKinney was a senior at Grand County High School and was well-known throughout the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Her friends mentioned that she was a kind-hearted girl with a big heart. She was even pursuing her EMT license to help people because she loved doing that.</p><p>She was also a talented athlete and intended to cheer at a basketball game on Friday where her brother was playing.&nbsp;</p><p>A staff member from Grand County High School has created<strong> “Zoe Strong Shirts”</strong> to honor her memory and raise funds for her family.</p><p>A memorial of flowers was also created at the trailhead where McKinney was hiking, the Moab Rim Trail. The trail is popular among locals; many have shared their memories of hiking it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it can be hazardous at this time of year, and people are urged to be mindful of their surroundings and take appropriate precautions.</p><p>Grand County High School officials have provided counseling resources to help students and faculty through this challenging time.&nbsp;</p><p>A GoFundMe has also been set up for those who donate to the family’s funeral expenses. The community has rallied around the McKinney family, offering support and condolences.</p><p>Assistant Chief Lex Bell with the Moab Police Department said McKinney’s death was heartbreaking, and the family members were on the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>He added that the Moab community is tight-knit, and everyone is coming together to support each other during this time.</p><p>Grand County High School issued a statement for McKinney on Friday evening.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2.5><p><strong>‘The school community is grieving with Zoe’s family and will provide love and support in any way we can, including having therapists available at school on Monday.
