Standing at an imposing height of 6 feet 10 inches, Johnson earned the nickname “The Big Unit” for his dominant presence on the mound.</p><p>Johnson attended Livermore High School in California, where he excelled in both baseball and basketball. His exceptional talent on the baseball field caught the attention of college scouts, leading him to enroll at the University of Southern California (USC). During his time at USC, Johnson showcased his immense potential, earning All-American honors and becoming one of the top prospects in collegiate baseball.</p><p>In the 1985 MLB Draft, Randy Johnson was selected by the Montreal Expos as the second overall pick. He made his professional debut with the Expos in 1988 but struggled with command issues early in his career. After spending parts of six seasons with the Expos, Johnson was traded to the Seattle Mariners in 1989, marking a turning point in his career.</p><p>It was with the Seattle Mariners that Johnson truly blossomed into one of the most dominant pitchers of his era. Armed with a blazing fastball that often touched triple digits on the radar gun, Johnson developed pinpoint control and a devastating slider. His combination of velocity and movement made him virtually unhittable.</p><p>During his tenure with the Mariners from 1989 to 1998, Johnson amassed numerous accolades.

In 1995, he played a pivotal role in guiding the Mariners to their first-ever playoff appearance. That season, Johnson led the league in strikeouts and ERA, solidifying his reputation as one of the most dominant pitchers in the game.</p><p>In 1998, Johnson was traded to the Houston Astros, where he finished the season before signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks as a free agent.

Johnson earned World Series Co-MVP honors alongside teammate Curt Schilling for their exceptional performances throughout the playoffs.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Randy Johnson recorded numerous milestones and achievements. He reached the elusive 300-win mark, finishing his career with 303 victories. His 4,875 strikeouts rank second on the all-time list, behind only Nolan Ryan. Johnson was a ten-time All-Star and received the Triple Crown for pitching twice, leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA.</p><p>After spending time with the New York Yankees (2005-2006) and a brief return to the Diamondbacks (2007-2008), Johnson concluded his remarkable career in 2009 with the San Francisco Giants. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the sport, Johnson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015.</p><p>Randy Johnson’s impact on the game extended beyond his statistics. His intimidating presence on the mound, coupled with his fierce competitiveness, left an indelible mark on baseball. He revolutionized the art of power pitching and inspired a generation of aspiring young hurlers.</p><p>Today, Randy Johnson remains one of the most revered figures in the history of Major League Baseball.
