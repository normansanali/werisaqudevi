negatively.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This means she has a net popularity rating of -32, down from -27 six weeks ago.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, other members of the royal family have seen their popularity ratings soar following the funeral of Prince Philip.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prince Edward, the youngest child of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, had the largest boost in positive opinion, rising from 41 per cent of Britons in March to 54 per cent last week.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Negative opinion fell from 26 per cent to 19 per cent.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prince Charles has also experienced a significant change in public regard, with his net popularity rating rising to +25 compared with +7 on March 12.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is a return to grace for the Prince of Wales, whose positive ratings dropped eight points to 49 per cent between March 2 and March 22, when Harry and Meghan spoke about their fallout with the Royal Family in an interview with Oprah.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Princess Anne, the Queen and Prince Philip’s second child, also saw her ratings improve, with seven

cent.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Only 9 per cent of Britons have a negative view of the Queen, down from 14 per cent.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is likely this upwards trend is in part due to public sympathy in the wake of Prince Philip’s death on April 9,&nbsp;although it could also partly represent a reversion to normal opinion as memories of the Oprah interview fade.</p><p
