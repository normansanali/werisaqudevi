Weird Al, also regarded as a “musical comedian,” is best renowned for writing songs that make people laugh. Weird Al Yankovic has published almost 150 original songs since the beginning of his career.</strong></p><p>He is a commercially successful artist, with over 12 million albums sold worldwide. Six of his albums have been certified platinum. Yankovic is most known for his humorous music videos, which he directs and uploads on YouTube.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Weird Al Yankovic?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Weird Al Yankovic</a> was born in Downey, California on October 23, 1959. Al’s father always pushed him as a child to “do for a living whatever makes you happy.” Yankovic took his first accordion instruction just before turning seven. Al’s love of music would develop from his initial interest in this instrument. After three years, Al Yankovic began teaching himself how to play the accordion and rock ‘n’ roll music by listening to Elton John tunes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At a young age, he was inspired by comedians such as Frank Zappa, Shel Silverstein, and Spike Jones. Yankovic began kindergarten a year early and finished high school two years ahead of his classmates. During his high school years, he participated in plays and clubs such as the National Forensic League and the “Volcano Worshippers Club.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many businesses does Weird Al Yankovic own?</h2><p>Al Yankovic began his career as a 16-year-old on Dr. Demento’s radio show when the radio presenter played the teen’s taped recordings of many parody songs. During this time, he also began to perform at local coffee shops on the accordion, playing songs like 2001: A Space Odyssey’s theme. Yankovic first became known as “Weird Al” while studying architecture at Cal Poly and working as a DJ for the school’s radio station. Yankovic’s nickname was really a negative label bestowed upon him by his classmates, but he decided to “take it on professionally.”</p><p>Since having a comedic song played on The Dr. Demento Radio Show in 1976 at the age of 16, Yankovic has sold over 12 million albums (as of 2015), released over 150 parodies and original songs, and performed over 1,000 live events. His work has garnered him five Grammy Awards and 11 nominations, as well as four gold and six platinum recordings in the United States. In 2006, nearly three decades into his career, he released his first top-ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (“White & Nerdy”). Mandatory Fun (2014) became his first number-one album within its first week of release.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Weird Al joined Michael J. Nelson on the RiffTrax audio commentary of Jurassic Park in 2008.</p><p>Weird Al was a guest “internet scientist” on Rocketboom’s “Know Your Meme” video series on November 10, 2009, in the installment on Auto-Tune, hosted by Jamie Wilkinson.</p><p>Yankovic then co-starred in another Funny or Die short with Huey Lewis, which imitated the axe murder scene in the film American Psycho, in which Christian Bale’s character Patrick Bateman examines the nature of Lewis’ musical work before murdering his victim.</p><p>On April 3, 2012, Weird Al began hosting a new comic celebrity interview online series, Face to Face with ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic, for The Nerdist Podcast. The show involves Al TV-style phony interviews with Hollywood stars.</p><p>Al has appeared on numerous other web shows, including CollegeHumor, LearningTown, Some Jerk with a Camera, Team Unicorn, and Epic Rap Battles of History, where he fought as Sir Isaac Newton against actors portraying Bill Nye, the Science Guy (YouTube star Nice Peter), and Neil DeGrasse Tyson (Chali 2na of Jurassic 5).</p><p>Yankovic partnered with the Gregory Brothers in October 2016 to make a music video for “Bad Hombres, Nasty Women” shortly after the third debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, featuring Yankovic singing between autotuned samples from the candidates. Yankovic partnered with the Gregory Brothers on a similar film following Trump and Joe Biden’s first debate in the 2020 race.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Investments does Weird Al Yankovic have?</h2><p>Al paid $2 million for a 7,000-square-foot mansion in the Hollywood Hills in 2001. Comparable surrounding homes recently sold for $7-9 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Endorsement deals has Weird Al Yankovic?</h2><p>A Beer Company offered Yankovic an endorsement deal, but he turned it down, the story goes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many charities have Weird Al Yankovic donated to?</h2><p>Weird Al Yankovic has donated to the following charities, which are listed on this website: Children’s Cancer Association, American Foundation for Equal Rights, and Human Rights Campaign.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Philanthropy works has Weird Al Yankovic supported?</h2><p>In 2011, he released a renamed Perform This Way version of Lady Gaga’s Born This Way to support funds for the Human Rights Campaign.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>www.ghgossip.com</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCcoqqUYq6tediapaSnpp6wcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fweird-al-yankovic.html&text=What%20is%20Her%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fweird-al-yankovic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fweird-al-yankovic.html&title=What%20is%20Her%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fweird-al-yankovic.html&title=What%20is%20Her%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fweird-al-yankovic.html&title=What%20is%20Her%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fweird-al-yankovic.html&description=What%20is%20Her%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1000lb-sisters-tammy-slaton-poses-swimsuit-dropping-to-285lb-weight-loss-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="1000-lb Sisters' Tammy Slaton poses in a swimsuit after dropping to 285lbs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-vince-vaughns-passion-for-acting.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Vince Vaughn's Passion For Acting?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
