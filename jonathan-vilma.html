It should also be noted that Jonathan Vilma’s club won the 2010 Super Bowl. Despite this, Vilma was far from a one-hit-wonder. As a result, his team looked to him as a natural leader who could guide them through the highs and lows of any situation.</p><p>Thus, he is often considered one of the greatest linebackers of his age. Since retiring from football, Jonathan has also become one of the country’s most extraordinary young football commentators.</p><p>So, how well-versed in the works are you on Jonathan Vilma? In addition to Jonathan Vilma’s 2022 net worth, we’ve included his age, height, weight, spouse, and children and his biography and other personal details.

After getting a scholarship to attend the University of Miami, Vilma enrolled there.</p><p>From 2000 through 2003, he played for the Miami Hurricanes <a href=#>football team</a>, where he impressed several NFL scouts. She was a three-time Academic All-Big East Parley selection when he concluded his four-year tenure. As a result, Jonathan graduated from the <a href=#>University</a> of Miami’s School of Business Administration in 2003 with a bachelor’s degree in finance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonathan Vilma Family:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Father</td><td>Fritz Vilma</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Nelly Vilma</td></tr><tr><td>Brothers</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Sisters</td><td>Alice Vilma</td></tr><tr><td>Grandfather</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Grandmother</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Relatives Name</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>On April 16th, 1982, in Florida, Fritz Vilma and Nelly Vilma gave birth to their son, Jonathan Polynice Vilma. In addition, Jonathan’s parents were born in Haiti and later moved to the United States. In addition, he was raised by his sister, Alice Vilma, in Florida. After hours of investigating, we were still unable to locate any information on his upbringing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonathan Vilma Zodiac Sign:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Sun Sign</td><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Sign Duality</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Sign Modality</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>A native of Coral Gables, Florida, Jonathan Vilma will be 39 years old in 2022.

Even though his athletic physique may no longer be helpful in the analysis studio, Jonathan exploited his body to its total capacity throughout his playing career to become one of the finest linebackers of his time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonathan Vilma Relationship Status:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Spouse Name</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Sons</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Daughters</td><td>Samaara Vilma</td></tr><tr><td>No Of Children</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>married</td></tr><tr><td>Partner Name</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Relationship Status</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>According to his Instagram postings, Jonathan is neither married nor in a relationship. The opposite is true: He’s done an excellent job hiding his romance. Adding insult to injury, we were also unable to learn anything about his prior relationships.</p><p>Samaara Vilma was revealed to be the 39-year-daughter. On the other hand, Old’s identity as Samaara’s biological mother remains a mystery to the media. Because the two squander a lot of time together, they have formed a solid friendship that they cherish. In addition, raising a child on one’s own is never an easy task. However, Jonathan deserves praise for the fantastic job he’s done raising his daughter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonathan Vilma Career:</h2><p>The New York Jets picked Jonathan as the 12th overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft, and that’s where he began his professional career. The stakes were high for the native Floridian after being selected as one of the top choices.</p><p>As a result, he became the NFL’s Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2013. Vilma also had 107 tackles, three interceptions, and two sacks during the season.</p><p>As a result, after a stellar rookie year, Jonathan was under even more pressure in his second season in the NFL. Moreover, the 39-year-old accomplished just that, leading the NFL with 169 tackles. While in the Pro Bowl, Vilma also made his first appearance.</p><p>The Florida native had another impressive season with the Jets with 114 tackles, one fumble recovery, one forced fumble, and an interception in his second year with the club.</p><p>However, Vilma’s fourth season with the team was a complete <a href=#>disaster</a>. Because he tore his ACL against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 7, terminating his season.</p><p>So the New Orleans Saints traded the 6’1″ linebacker for a fourth-round selection choice in the 2008 NFL Draft and a second-round draft pick in the 2009 NFL Draft because of the linebacker’s injuries and a short contract.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Saints of New Orleans</h3><p>Everyone anticipated Jonathan to need some time to adjust to his new surroundings once he was moved to the Saints. The contrary was true, as he was the only bright spot in a lousy defense that gave up a lot of touchdowns.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was a successful first season for the 39-year-old, who finished with 132 tackles and one sack in 16 appearances. No one predicted that the New Orleans Saints would win the Super Bowl the following year, much less that they would go to the finals.</p><p>Despite this, Vilma led his club to the Super Bowl XLIV by making several crucial plays that helped them defeat Indianapolis 31-17. On top of that, Jonathan was chosen to play in his second straight Pro Bowl.</p><p>Afterward, Vilma had a solid 2010 season, leading the squad in tackles, but had a knee injury in 2011. Vilma’s 2012 season was not anticipated by anybody, even the New Orleans Saints. It was reported during the 2012 season that Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams paid his players cash in exchange for knocking out opposing players.</p><p>In the 2009 NFC Championship Game, Vilma is said to have offered his colleagues $10,000 to kill Brett Favre. Jonathan was thus suspended for the remainder of the 2012 season. It was a pittance compared to the enormous damage done to his long-established reputation.</p><p>Even though Vilma had an injury-filled 2013 season, he formally retired from the NFL in 2014 following a season plagued by injuries. The New Orleans Saints recognized Jonathan’s services in 2017 by inducting him into the team’s Hall of Fame.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>On The ESPN Side Of Things After Retirement.</h3><p>Vilma has been a college football commentator for ESPN since he retired from the NFL in 2014. One of the most excellent game analyzers in the world, Jonathan has established himself in a short period as one of the best in the business.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonathan Vilma Social Media Appearance:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"></figure><p>Many people admire Jonathan Vilma, a well-known former NFL player. Along with his impressive Instagram following of 18.3K, he is also well-known for his artistic photography. You may also follow Jonathan Vilma on Facebook, where he has 89 thousand fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonathan Vilma Net Worth:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$21 million</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Annual Earnings</td><td>$3.7 million</td></tr><tr><td>Source Of Income</td><td>Sports – NFL</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Vilma will have a net worth of $21 million by 2022, most of which he has amassed during his sporting career. Like the 39-year-old, who began his professional career at 22 before playing ten seasons in the NFL.</p><p>Injury setbacks prevented him from playing as much as he may have. As a <a href=#>college football</a> commentator for ESPN, Jonathan also gets an annual compensation of $70,000.</p><p>In contrast, he earned an average annual pay of $3.7 million over his ten-year career in the NFL, even though the number seemed small. This led to Vilma’s final salary of $37.3 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>Why was Vilma put on leave?<br></strong>The Saints Bountygate Scandal resulted in the season-long suspension of Jonathan Vilma.</p><p><strong>Is Jonathan Vilma a Broadcaster or <a href=#>Host</a>?</strong><br>Vilma began functional as a <a href=#>sports broadcaster</a> for numerous networks when he retired from football.</p><p><strong>In what year did Vilma hang up her boots?</strong><br>The 6th of December, 2015, was his last day as a professional <a href=#>football player</a>.</p><p><strong>Jonathan’s New York Giants jersey number?<br></strong>Jonathan is the proud owner of the No. 51 jersey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57yailmqyYlrtuwsilpJpn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjonathan-vilma.html&text=Jonathan%20Vilma%3a%20NFL%2c%20Wife%2c%20Footballer%2c%20Jersey%2c%20Net%20Worth%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjonathan-vilma.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjonathan-vilma.html&title=Jonathan%20Vilma%3a%20NFL%2c%20Wife%2c%20Footballer%2c%20Jersey%2c%20Net%20Worth%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjonathan-vilma.html&title=Jonathan%20Vilma%3a%20NFL%2c%20Wife%2c%20Footballer%2c%20Jersey%2c%20Net%20Worth%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjonathan-vilma.html&title=Jonathan%20Vilma%3a%20NFL%2c%20Wife%2c%20Footballer%2c%20Jersey%2c%20Net%20Worth%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjonathan-vilma.html&description=Jonathan%20Vilma%3a%20NFL%2c%20Wife%2c%20Footballer%2c%20Jersey%2c%20Net%20Worth%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lord-of-the-rings-series-to-use-practical-orcs-introduce-female-orcs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lord of the Rings Series to Use Practical Orcs, Introduce Female Orcs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-passion-fruit-the-same-as-maypop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is passion fruit the same as maypop?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
