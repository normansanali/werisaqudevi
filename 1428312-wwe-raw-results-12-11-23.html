Pearce hands Punk the mic as the crowd chants his name. Punk says they have a huge decision to make. He’s been thinking about it all week. Punk says he loves this crowd, but this town and building haven’t been kind to him. He had his first match here. He had Mickie James on his arm, and he thought it went great. It went so great that when he got to the back, they told him he was going to OVW. He didn’t want to go, but he did.</p><p>The next time he was in this town, he was the world heavyweight champion.

But if Punk is going to be a part of WWE again, Rollins wants Punk on Raw. The truth always comes out, and everyone knows this is Punk’s last chance. Rollins says Punk is either going to self-destruct, and Rollins will be the to slam the door on Punk’s legacy. If there is some chance that Punk has anything left in the tank and Punk is lucky enough to stand across from Rollins in a world title match, Rollins promises to expose Punk and show him in real time what it means to be the best in the world.</p><h4 id=h-check-out-last-week-s-coverage-wwe-raw-results-12-4-23-2>Check Out Last Week’s Coverage: <a href=#>WWE Raw Results (12/4/23)</a></h4><p>Punk asks Rollins if he is done.

Lynch throws a couple of jabs Jax’s way before Jax’s music hits, and she power walks to the ring. Jax says she isn’t fired anymore and is right here in front of Lynch, better than ever.
