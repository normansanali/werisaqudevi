The brother-sister duo is appearing on E! show with their mother Kia Brooks on the show Raising a F***ing Star. We know by now that they are half-siblings who share the same mother. But, what about Tray’s father, and who is he? What is Tray’s job?</p><p>This Tray Milton Bio helps you explore all the details. So delve in to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>Tray Milton On Raising a F***ing Star</strong></h3><p>E! premiered a new show titled Raising a F***ing Star. The show followed four families searching for fame through their kids and believing that they got what it takes to be the next household name. The show adopted its theme from the 2004 series Showbiz Moms & Dads.</p><p>Tray Milton, is one of the family members appearing on the E!’s show. To be more precise, he is a member of the Brooks family. His sister is Flau’Jae Johnson, who aspires to be a star, and their mom is Kia Brooks, the momager of his sister. Flau’jae already has an upper hand because her father Jason “Camoflauge” Johnson was a well-established rapper from the 1990s and early 200s.</p><p>The rapper sadly passed away in 2003 and now Tray’s sister believes that she is the one that her father handed the torch and she is ready to run with it. But, Tray doesn’t feel the same because he feels that his mother is prioritizing his sister more over him. He thinks that she is pulling a Kris Jenner on him, as he also wants to be a musician.</p><p>So, we can certainly expect some sibling rivalry between the two based on that.</p><h3><strong>Tray Milton Dad</strong></h3><p>Trayron Lennoris Milton Jr. Was born to his dad Trayron Milton Sr.</p><p>Born in April 1981, Tray Milton Sr is currently 41 years old. The father-son duo doesn’t seem to share a very pleasant relationship. Instead, he is close to his stepdad Ameen Brooks.</p><p>In May 2019, on Ameen’s birthday, he dedicated a post to his stepdad on his Facebook. He wished him saying, “I just wanna take the time to say thank you for being one of the most God-fearing, family-oriented, respectful, compassionate, nurturing, vigilant, and remarkable human beings I’ve ever met in my entire life. Your ability to light up a room with just your presence alone is undoubtedly one of your most amazing qualities. After being hurt so many times in my life by individuals, you are the closest thing to an actual father figure that I’ve ever had.”</p><p>He concluded, “You’re patient with my mother, sister, brother, and all the baggage we come with. So for that, I will forever be grateful for God taking the time to put you in my life. I wish I could be there with you on your special day but you know I’m locking these grades down so I can pay you and Kia back for everything y’all have done for me. Happy Birthday”</p><p>A year before that on Ameen’s 36th birthday, Tray described his stepdad as “the most ambitious man” he knows.</p><p>On Father’s Day 2014, Tray wrote on Facebook, “But On A Real Note… Happy Father’s Day To My Mother! <a class="qi72231t nu7423ey n3hqoq4p r86q59rh b3qcqh3k fq87ekyn bdao358l fsf7x5fv rse6dlih s5oniofx m8h3af8h l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk srn514ro oxkhqvkx rl78xhln nch0832m cr00lzj9 rn8ck1ys s3jn8y49 icdlwmnq cxfqmxzd d1w2l3lo tes86rjd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#><span class=rse6dlih>Lakia Jones</span></a> Strongest Person I Know!”</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Tray Milton?</strong></h3><p>1999 marked the year Tray Milton was born. In September 2021, he celebrated turning 22 years old.</p><h3><strong>Tray Milton Height</strong></h3><p>According to his profile on Maxpreps, Tray Milton stands tall at 6 feet. He weighed around 170 lbs during his time in high school.</p><h3><strong>Tray Milton Career</strong></h3><p>As already stated, Tray Milton is also an aspiring musician. He goes by the name Tray Milz. He entered the R&B game to bring raw, relatable, and catchy melodies to this millennium. Moreover, his artistry takes listeners to the pop side of R&B and exudes a melodic mood to rhythm and blues.</p><p>Tray’s musical path is a narrative of unwavering passion and perseverance rather than an overnight success. Since he was a little child, his love for all forms of entertainment has been obvious.</p><p>The young singer/songwriter draws his inspiration from the likes of Chris Brown, Usher, and Trey Songz. Tray’s debut album&nbsp;21 was released on September 25, 2022, and is already gaining numbers in view. He has released songs titled Someone Else’s Girl, Friend Zone, I Wanna Know, One Heart Left, Good Days, and Expectations.</p><p>Tray also spoke about his approach to songwriting saying, “In order to create, I have to have the beat or music, and from there I develop a tune or melody in my head. And the last step would be coming up with the pain and trauma to fill in the words.”</p><p>According to his LinkedIn, he is signed with Vibe Star Entertainment since January 2020.</p><p>Additionally, Tray has also released a song titled Somebody collaborating with his sister Flau’Jae which is in his album. He <a href=#>cited</a> his younger sister as an inspiration for him to pursue music. Recently in September 2022, Flau’Jae signed a shoe deal with Puma. Tray tweeted it by <a href=#>captioning</a> it, “Proudest Brother in the world.”</p><p>You can find his music on SoundCloud, YouTube, Apple Music, and Spotify.</p><p>During an interview, he shared that his Tray five-year goal is to share his music with crowds at concerts and festivals, leading them as they sing along to his songs. The young artist hopes to build his career and become an established artist, like the pop stars that inspire him.</p><p>Tray has also experimented in every aspect of entertainment. This prodigy, now age 21, has experience in the industry thanks to her modeling in New York Fashion Week, being noticed in a few movies, and traveling with Mindless Behavior and OMG Girlz as a backup dancer when she was only 14 years old. The young artist was forced to follow his other love and enter the music industry.</p><p>He is also a college student at Georgia Southern University. He completed high school at Sprayberry High School where he played varsity football.</p><h3><strong>Is Tray Milton On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Tray Milton is on Instagram (<a href=#>@traymilz</a>), Facebook (<a href=#>@traymil</a>), and Twitter (<a href=#>@tray_milz</a>).</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Tray Milton Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tray Milton celebrates his birthday on 24 September.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Tray Milton Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tray Milton is currently residing in Atlanta, Georgia.
