His estimated base salary was $610,000 with a $6.58 million total cap in 2020; it was $2.25 million with a $8.2 million total cap in 2021; $3.9 million with a $9.87 million total cap in 2022; and it was anticipated to be $5.5 million with a $11.5 million total cap in 2023.</p><p>Joe may receive a contract extension once the term of his rookie agreement expires for a stunning $408 million on an 8-year deal with a fully guaranteed $142.6 million and $240 million in total guarantees. He will become the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history as a result of this deal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Joe-Burrow.jpg><h3>Endorsements</h3><p><strong>The former top choice is extremely marketable and has received numerous endorsement deals from major brands like Nike, Bose, Nerf and Fanatics. </strong>A contract was reached between Bose and Joe Burrow. A multi-year contract with Fanatics was also accepted by him.</p><p>Joe Burrow’s official signature on a football costs $400, while his autograph on a jersey for the LSU Tigers or Cincinnati Bengals costs roughly $600. Due to his endorsement agreement with Nike, Burrow also wore a unique tee that was monogrammed with his 740 area code.</p><p>A month later, the garment giant allegedly released a replica of the t-shirt in its stores.&nbsp;The quarterback has been approached by numerous businesses, but only a small number of them have been successful.</p><h3>Other Sources of Income</h3><p>Joe earns money in addition to his salary and endorsement deals through appearances, social media posts, licensing, memorabilia and bonuses.

The athlete’s father once made fun of him, calling him “a millionaire living in his parent’s basement” but it doesn’t appear like he’s in a rush to leave.</p><p>The Burrows paid $240,000 to purchase the house. As of 2022, the property is estimated to be worth roughly $325,000. It is a 2,661 square-foot single-family home in The Plains, Athens Country, Ohio, that has 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms and is located on a cul-de-sac.</p><p>Burrow also has his own property, where he built his starting home in June 2020 for less than a million dollars. For $835,000, he acquired a 2,900 square foot residence in Cincinnati, Ohio’s Columbia-Tusculum area, the oldest part of the city.</p><p>The Home was constructed in 2014. About 5 miles to the northeast of downtown and Paul Brown Stadium sits the two-story house.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Near Cincinnati, Ohio, Burrow has a customized Lordstown EV pickup truck, a Porsche Taycan supercar, an Acura NSX supercar and perhaps a golf cart. His first car was a Lordstown truck called “Endurance” that was made just for him in Lordstown, Ohio.</p><p>The Bengals’ colors, “Working Joe,” Joe’s jersey number “9,” and the Bengals’ logo are all displayed on the car’s door. The Endurance has estimated a 7,500-pound towing capacity and 2000/4800 FT-LB of torque. It can go 250 miles and charges in 10 hours.</p><p>The Porsche Taycan, which costs an estimated $150,000 is suddenly Joe’s go-to vehicle. The Taycan accelerates quickly and moves very quickly. Its elegant and roomy interior can convey a genuine sense of luxury.</p><h3><strong>Where Does Joe Burrow Spend His Money?</strong></h3><p>On December 14, 2019, Joe Burrow was selected as the 85th recipient of the Heisman Memorial Trophy which is awarded yearly to the top college football player. Instead of just talking about football during his victory speech, he talked about the underprivileged and disadvantaged people he knew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Joe-Burrow-1.jpg><p>Joe and his parents, along with business and community leaders from Ohio and Louisiana used that event as a springboard to launch the Joe Burrow Foundation.</p><p><strong>The primary focus is on helping children who are suffering from mental illness and those who are experiencing food poverty</strong>, in addition to providing resources and support to the underprivileged and marginalized in many ways.</p><p>The Joe Burrow Foundation seeks to impart to these children the same zeal, dedication and resourcefulness that Joe possesses on the football field.</p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow our Twitter account</a> for more information related to other stars’ net worth, investments and their financial status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxzfI6jpp5lkqq%2Fs7vWZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoe-burrow-net-worth.html&text=Joe%20Burrow%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Explore%20His%20Financial%20Success&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-burrow-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-burrow-net-worth.html&title=Joe%20Burrow%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Explore%20His%20Financial%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoe-burrow-net-worth.html&title=Joe%20Burrow%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Explore%20His%20Financial%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-burrow-net-worth.html&title=Joe%20Burrow%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Explore%20His%20Financial%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-burrow-net-worth.html&description=Joe%20Burrow%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Explore%20His%20Financial%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kristian-alfonso-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristian Alfonso  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-gerry-turner-the-golden-bachelor-engaged-exploring-gerry-turners-background-is-he-jewish.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Gerry Turner, the Golden Bachelor, Engaged?
