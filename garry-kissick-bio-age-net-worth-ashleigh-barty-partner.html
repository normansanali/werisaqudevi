They kept their engagement private for about a week before both of them publicly announced via their socials.</p><p>Whereas Ashleigh shared about her engagement, “Garry and I have been together for a long time now and I had designed the ring with him. We are excited now for the next chapter. We were at home on the couch with the puppies. It was very much just us. It was perfect for us.”</p><p>Ashleigh also went on her IG and captioned the picture: “Future Husband,” alongside a ring and heart emoji.</p><p>In another post, Garry wrote on his IG, “You amaze me, every single day! So incredibly proud of you babe”.</p><h3><strong>Garry Kissick Age</strong></h3><p>At the time of this writing in late January 2022, Garry Kissick was 30 years old.</p><h3><strong>What Does Garry Kissick Do?</strong></h3><p>On Garry Kissick’s LinkedIn bio he wrote, “I have been a golfer all my life so working in the golf industry has always been my passion.
