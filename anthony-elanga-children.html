He shares the same parents as his two sisters, Chanelle Elanga and Sandra Elanga.</p><p>Elanga&nbsp;stands at a height of 1.78 m tall and weighs 70kg. He is very fluent in three languages, English, Swedish and French.</p><p>Elanga’s&nbsp;family relocated to England and settled in Manchester after he played for IF Elfsborg and Malmö FF in Sweden. Before jo ining Manchester United at the age of 12,&nbsp;Elanga&nbsp;briefly played for the local team Hattersley and was noticed by both Manchester City and United.</p><p><a href=#>Elanga&nbsp;</a>made his under-18 team debut for Manchester United in a 2-1 road loss to Liverpool in April 2018 at the age of 15. In his first full season of play with the Under-18s, he scored four goals in 22 appearances as a Manchester United academy scholar after signing in July 2018.</p><p>The following year,&nbsp;<a href=#>Elanga&nbsp;</a>made two substitute appearances for the Under-21s in the EFL Trophy. With 7 goals in 9 games, he concluded the COVID-shortened Under-18s season as the league’s top scorer and took up the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award.</p><p><a href=#><strong>READ ALSO: Anthony Elanga Girlfriend: Meet China Navana</strong></a></p><p>He scored twice while playing four games for the club’s under-21 team in the 2020–21 EFL Trophy. Prior to the 2020–21 Premier League season,&nbsp;<a href=#>Elanga&nbsp;</a>made his first-team United debut in a preseason friendly against Aston Villa. He replaced Marcus Rashford in the 75th minute of a 1-0 loss.</p><p><a href=#>Elanga&nbsp;</a>was called up to the first team for the 2020-21 UEFA Europa League quarterfinal matches against Granada in April 2021 after agreeing to a new long-term contract with the team in March 2021, but he was not used as a substitute in either of the matches nor in the second leg of the semi-final against Roma on May 6, 2021.</p><p>On May 11, against Leicester City in the Premier League, he made his club’s debut in a competitive encounter. Marcus Rashford took over for&nbsp;Elanga&nbsp;in the 66th minute of United’s 2-1 defeat.</p><p>On the final day of the league season,&nbsp;Elanga&nbsp;made his second start against Wolverhampton Wanderers, and after just 13 minutes, he had scored his first goal as a senior for Manchester United.</p><p>On January 19, 2022,&nbsp;Elanga notched his first of the year in a 3-1 away victory over Brentford as his second league goal for Manchester United.&nbsp;</p><p>Elanga&nbsp;missed his team’s final penalty in an 8-7 shootout against Middlesbrough during their FA Cup match on February 4 of that year, eliminating Manchester United from the Cup for the year.</p><p>Elanga&nbsp;experienced racial abuse on social media in the days following the game.&nbsp;Elanga&nbsp;was struck in the head on February 20 during a game against Leeds United when a fan threw something at him.</p><p>Elanga&nbsp;scored his second league goal of the season just before the game ended.&nbsp;Elanga’s&nbsp;first UEFA Champions League goal came on February 23 against Atlético Madrid in the Round of 16 first leg; the result was a 1-1 draw.</p><p>Elanga&nbsp;was qualified to compete on the international stage for either Sweden, Cameroon, or England. At the under-17, under-19, under-21, and senior levels, he has represented Sweden.</p><p>During the 2019 UEFA European Under-17 Championship,&nbsp;Elanga&nbsp;scored two goals while playing five times for the Sweden under-17 team, both goals coming against France. On June 3, 2021, he participated in his first game for the Sweden under-21 team and scored one goal against Finland.</p><p>Elanga&nbsp;made the decision to play for Sweden at the senior level, citing his affinity for the nation as well as the fact that he was born and raised there and has spent most of his life there.</p><p>He was included in Janne Andersson’s international team for the March 2022 World Cup qualifiers against the Czech Republic, where he also made his debut as a late-game replacement. On June 5, 2022, in a 1-2 loss to Norway in a UEFA Nations League B match,&nbsp;Elanga&nbsp;scored his first goal at the senior international level.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Anthony Elanga have children?</h2><p><a href=#>Elanga </a>and his girlfriend, China Navana have no child at the moment.
