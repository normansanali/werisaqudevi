He also attended teacher training college for two years in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, before again returning to his hometown. In 1976, Neeson joined the Lyric Players’ Theatre in Belfast, where he performed for two years. He got his first film experience in 1977, playing Jesus Christ and Evangelist in the religious film Pilgrim’s Progress.</p><p>Neeson moved to Dublin in 1978 after he was offered a part in Ron Hutchinson’s Says I, Says He, a drama about The Troubles, at the Project Arts Centre. He acted in several other Projects productions and joined the Abbey Theatre (the National Theatre of Ireland).[citation needed] In 1980, he performed alongside Stephen Rea, Ray McAnally, and Mick Lally, playing Doalty in Brian Friel’s play Translations, the first production of Friel’s and Rea’s Field Day Theatre Company, first presented in the Guildhall, Derry, on 23 September 1980.</p><p>In 1980, filmmaker John Boorman saw him on stage as Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men and offered him the role of Sir Gawain in the Arthurian film Excalibur. After Excalibur, Neeson moved to London, where he continued working on stage, in small budget films, and in television.</p><p>He lived with the actress Helen Mirren at this time, whom he met working on Excalibur. Between 1982 and 1987, Neeson starred in five films, most notably alongside Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins in 1984’s The Bounty and Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons in 1986’s The Mission. Neeson guest-starred in the third season of the television series Miami Vice in 1986 and moved to Hollywood to star in more high-profile roles in the next year.</p><p>That year, he starred alongside Cher and Dennis Quaid in Suspect, a role that brought him critical acclaim. In 1988, he starred alongside Clint Eastwood in the fifth Dirty Harry film, “The Dead Pool”, in the role of Peter Swan, a horror film director. In 1990, he followed this with a starring role in Sam Raimi’s Darkman. Although the film was successful, Neeson’s subsequent years did not bring him the same recognition.</p><p>In 1993, he joined Ellis Island co-star and future wife Natasha Richardson in the Broadway play, Anna Christie. They also worked together in Nell, released the following year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=liam-neeson-cold-pursuit></span><span>Liam Neeson Cold Pursuit</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cold Pursuit is a 2019 action thriller film directed by Hans Petter Moland from a screenplay by Frank Baldwin.

At their hotel, as Liz goes to check in, Harris realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and takes a taxi to retrieve it (without telling Liz). The taxi is involved in an accident and crashes into the Spree, knocking him unconscious. The driver rescues him but flees the scene. Harris regains consciousness at a hospital and learns he has been in a coma for four days.</p><p>Desperate to find his wife, who he realizes doesn’t know what happened to him, Harris returns to the hotel. There he discovers Liz with another man who she says is her husband and declares she does not know Harris. The police are called and he attempts to call a colleague named Cole, to no avail. Stating he wants to go back to the hospital, he dodges the police but finds himself being followed. While on a train, he loses the man following him and writes down his schedule for the next day from memory.</p><p>Harris is able to track Gina, the taxi driver who saved him, but she is an illegal Bosnian immigrant and is afraid to help him. He then goes to visit the office of Prof. Leo Bressler, whom he is scheduled to meet, only to find “Dr. Harris” is already there.</p><p>As Harris attempts to prove his identity, “Harris” provides identification and a family photo, both of which have his face. Overwhelmed by the identity crisis, Harris falls unconscious and awakens back at the hospital. Smith (the man who was following him), an apparent assassin sent to target Harris, kills Gretchen Erfurt, Harris’s attending nurse, but Harris escapes.</p><p>Harris seeks help from Erfurt’s friend, private investigator and former Stasi agent Ernst Jürgen. Harris’s only clues are his father’s book on botany and Gina, who has been working at a diner since the crash. While Harris persuades her to help him, Jürgen researches Harris and the biotechnology summit, discovering it is to be attended by Prince Shada of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The prince is funding a secret project headed by Bressler and has survived numerous assassination attempts. Jürgen suspects that identity theft might be related.</p><p>Harris and Gina are attacked in her apartment by Smith and another assassin, Jones; they escape after Gina kills Smith. In his book, Harris finds that Liz has written a series of numbers that correspond to words found on specific pages.</p><p>Using his schedule, Harris confronts Liz alone; she tells him he got in the taxi because he left his briefcase at the airport and that she will meet him there. Meanwhile, Jürgen receives Cole at his office and reveals his findings of a secret assassination group known as Section 15.</p><p>Jürgen soon deduces that Cole is a former mercenary and member of the group; knowing Cole is there to interrogate and kill him and with no way of escape, Jürgen commits suicide to protect Harris.</p><p>After retrieving his briefcase, Harris parts ways with Gina. When she sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, she steals a taxi and follows them. When Harris awakes, Cole explains that “Martin Harris” is just a cover name created by Harris and Liz was his professional teammate.</p><p>His head injury caused him to believe the persona was real; when Liz notified Cole of the injury, “Harris” was activated as his replacement. He continues to explain Harris is a trained assassin that they have to eliminate. Gina drives up in time to save Harris, running over Jones before he can kill Harris, then rams the van Cole is in over a railing, killing him as well.</p><p>During the commotion, Harris finds a hidden compartment in his briefcase containing two Canadian passports, remembering that he and Liz were in Berlin three months prior to plant a bomb in Prince Shada’s suite.</p><p>Now aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Martin seeks to redeem himself by thwarting it. Hotel security immediately holds Martin and Gina, but Martin proves his earlier visit to the hotel. After being convinced of the bomb’s presence, security evacuates the hotel.</p><p>Harris realizes that Prince Shada is not Section 15’s target, but rather Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn capable of surviving harsh climates. If Bressler is killed and his research is stolen, his findings would be worth billions of dollars should they fall into the wrong hands. Liz, who previously accessed Bressler’s laptop and stole the data, tells “Harris” to complete their mission in getting rid of Bressler, while she disarms the bomb they no longer need.</p><p>Unable to disarm it in time, Liz is blown up. During the evacuation, Harris stops “Harris” from killing Bressler and kills him, ending Section 15’s plans for good. Gina finds Harris and they escape during the aftermath of the bombing.</p><p>As the bombing is identified as a failed assassination of Prince Shada, Bressler announces he is making his corn available to the world for free. As the announcement is televised, Harris and Gina board a train together with new identities.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=liam-neeson-movies-on-netflix></span><span>Liam Neeson Movies On Netflix</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A Monster Calls (2016)<br>A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014)<br>The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018)<br>Battleship (2012)<br>Chloe (2009)<br>The Commuter (2018)<br>Les Misérables (1998)<br>Operation Chromite (2016)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=liam-neeson-taken></span><span>Liam Neeson Taken</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taken is a 2008 English-language French action thriller film written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, and directed by Pierre Morel.
