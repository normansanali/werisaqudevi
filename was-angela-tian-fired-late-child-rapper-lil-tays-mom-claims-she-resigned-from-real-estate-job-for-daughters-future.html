A look at 'Echo' star's private life with wife Samantha Thomas</a></p><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: After news broke that Lil Tay, the foul-mouthed child rapper with 1.7 million Instagram fans, had died, rumors about her family started circulating online. One such rumor claimed Lil Tay's mom was fired from her position at a Vancouver real estate firm.</p><p>However, in reality, Angela Tian was not let go by Pacific Place Group. Jim Lew, director of business development for Pacific Place Group, was contacted by Daily Hive and initially claimed that Tian had been "dismissed" from the organization.</p><p>Lew revised his initial statement in a subsequent email, claiming that Tian "resigned" before his colleague David Yang, managing partner of Pacific Evergreen Realty, "had a chance to let her go." Tian was one of Yang's recruits, as reported by<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Daily Hive.</a></p><h2 class=split>'We had to dismiss her'</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>How did Alaqua Cox lose her leg?

Tian had been spotted filming her daughter for one of her videos. Jim Lew earlier said, "When we found out about this activity last week we had to dismiss her," noting the behaviour in Lil Tay's videos has "no place" in the real estate industry.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Alaqua Cox's boyfriend? How 'Echo' star beat the odds to become Marvel's hero</a></p><h2 class=split>'I didn't get fired. I resigned'</h2><p>Angela Tian told Juju Chang during her interview with 'Good Morning America', "I didn't get fired. I resigned for my daughter's career and her bright future." She added, "I don't want to deal with all these questions anymore. Can you please help out my daughter's career more?"</p><p>She further added, "All the haters, they want to get attention from her because right now, she's famous, and she has a passion. Every parent needs to worry about their own child. I'll worry about my child. She's a star now, and wherever she is, I will be beside her."</p><h2 class=split>'I disagreed with most of the social media activity'</h2><p>Angela aka Angie and Lil Tay's dad, Christopher J. Hope aka Chris, were given joint custody in October 2018. But Chris was given complete authority over the child's legal matters. Chris told Hollywood Life, "When my daughter’s social media began to go viral this year, I disagreed with most of the social media activity." He added, "I took legal steps to stop things which I felt were dangerous to her physical and mental health and to her future. I do not think a 10-year-old girl should be put in those situations and made to drop out of school so that she can make money for other people."</p><h2 class=split>Tay and elder brother died on on Aug 9</h2><p>He added, "Everyone else involved in this situation is motivated by money and the possibility of making money off of my daughter. I am not fighting about money; I am fighting for my daughter, for her happiness, and her future. According to a report, Tay died on August 9. The announcement also confirmed Tay's older brother Jason's death.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'Sounds fire': Fans praise Alabama Barker, compare her with rapper Latto as she drops snippet of her unreleased song</a></p><p><a href=#>Golden Globes 2024: Internet amused as Kieran Culkin roasts 'The Last of Us', says 'suck it' to Pedro Pascal after his win</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5GoeqK6xp6jmmWknq6vecWiqZ6cXaGutbGMnJ%2BipJRiv6K8z56pZqSZoXq1rdisZKannWKwra3Ipqpmq5iaerOx0qKep52UYrOzu8xmqZ6ZnGKytMDArZxmop%2BXeqe70Wabmq2XncGmvtJmna6spaey</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwas-angela-tian-fired-late-child-rapper-lil-tays-mom-claims-she-resigned-from-real-estate-job-for-daughters-future.html&text=Was%20Angela%20Tian%20fired%3f%20Child%20rapper%20Lil%20Tay%27s%20mom%20claims%20she%20resigned%20from%20real%20estate%20job%20for%20%27daug&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwas-angela-tian-fired-late-child-rapper-lil-tays-mom-claims-she-resigned-from-real-estate-job-for-daughters-future.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwas-angela-tian-fired-late-child-rapper-lil-tays-mom-claims-she-resigned-from-real-estate-job-for-daughters-future.html&title=Was%20Angela%20Tian%20fired%3f%20Child%20rapper%20Lil%20Tay%27s%20mom%20claims%20she%20resigned%20from%20real%20estate%20job%20for%20%27daug" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwas-angela-tian-fired-late-child-rapper-lil-tays-mom-claims-she-resigned-from-real-estate-job-for-daughters-future.html&title=Was%20Angela%20Tian%20fired%3f%20Child%20rapper%20Lil%20Tay%27s%20mom%20claims%20she%20resigned%20from%20real%20estate%20job%20for%20%27daug" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwas-angela-tian-fired-late-child-rapper-lil-tays-mom-claims-she-resigned-from-real-estate-job-for-daughters-future.html&title=Was%20Angela%20Tian%20fired%3f%20Child%20rapper%20Lil%20Tay%27s%20mom%20claims%20she%20resigned%20from%20real%20estate%20job%20for%20%27daug" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwas-angela-tian-fired-late-child-rapper-lil-tays-mom-claims-she-resigned-from-real-estate-job-for-daughters-future.html&description=Was%20Angela%20Tian%20fired%3f%20Child%20rapper%20Lil%20Tay%27s%20mom%20claims%20she%20resigned%20from%20real%20estate%20job%20for%20%27daug" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./was-mason-at-kourtney-travis-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was Kourtney Kardashian's Son Mason at her wedding with Travis Barker?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./title-trina-wages-war-with-trick-daddy-in-season-2-premiere-of-love-hip-hop-miami.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trina Wages War With Trick Daddy In Season 2 Premiere Of &amp;quot;Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop: Miami&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
