None of his admirers saw him getting cozy with a possible girlfriend on the street or on social media. His success and fortune, on the other hand, attracted a lot of females to him.</p><p>Because of this, some people thought he was a gay man who was not open about his sexual orientation. Fahim, on the other hand, never yielded to the urge to say anything about it. As a result, details about his sexual orientation have faded with his death in July of 2020.</p><h2><span id=Arrested_Personal_Assistant>Arrested Personal Assistant!</span></h2><p>Tyrese Devon Haspel was arrested on July 17, 2020, three days after Fahim Saleh’s dismembered body was found. Tyrese, who was 21 at the time, served as Fahim’s personal assistant.</p><p>Tyrese’s reason for killing Fahim, according to sources who talked to PEOPLE Magazine, was financial. Their rivalry began when Fahim found that Tyrese had stolen thousands of dollars from his bank account. Rather than turning to the authorities, Fahim had arranged for Tyrese to refund the stolen money over time. Authorities filed multiple charges against Tyrese after his conviction, including second-degree murder.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Computer Engineer</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rm6CoZpOkunCywKGgpmWjlrmmtI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffahim-saleh.html&text=Fahim%20Saleh&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffahim-saleh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffahim-saleh.html&title=Fahim%20Saleh" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffahim-saleh.html&title=Fahim%20Saleh" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffahim-saleh.html&title=Fahim%20Saleh" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffahim-saleh.html&description=Fahim%20Saleh" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./healthy-hot-chocolate.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Healthy Hot Chocolate">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fact-check-was-heather-armstrong-anti-trans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fact Check: Was Heather Armstrong Anti Trans?
