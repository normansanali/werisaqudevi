Since the announcement of his death, Ken Squier’s age, wife, net worth, children, height, and many more things about his personal life have become topical issues.</p><p>In this article, we are going to delve into the details of Ken Squier’s age and many other things about him.</p><p>Kenley Dean Squier was an American sportscaster and motorsports editor from Waterbury, Vermont, who lived from April 10, 1935, until November 15, 2023.</p><p>He provided lap-by-lap commentary for NASCAR on CBS from 1979 to 1997. From 1983 to 1999, he did the same for TBS. In 1979, Squier became the first broadcaster to provide a lap-by-lap analysis of the Daytona 500.</p><p>He helped launch the Australian-developed in-car camera for the 1982 Daytona 500 and came up with the moniker “The Great American Race” for the race. Up until his passing, he resided in Stowe, Vermont.</p><p>The administration of the WDEV radio station in Waterbury, Vermont, where Squier was the owner, announced his death on Wednesday night.</p><p>“Though he never sat behind the wheel of a stock car, Ken Squier contributed to the growth of NASCAR as much as any competitor,” Jim France, chairman and CEO of NASCAR, said in a statement. He called him a superb storyteller whose voice is the soundtrack to many of NASCAR’s great moments.</p><p>“His calls on TV and radio brought fans closer to the sport, and for that, he was a fan favorite. Ken knew no strangers, and he will be missed by all.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ken-squier-age-how-old-was-he><strong>Ken Squier Age: How Old Was He?</strong></h2><p>His birthplace was Waterbury, Vermont, U.S., and he was born on April 10, 1935. This means that Ken Squier’s age was 88 when he died.</p><p>Stowe, Vermont, U.S., was where he died on November 15, 2023.</p><p>November 2020 saw Squier contract COVID-19. Squier’s condition was fully recovered by April 2021, following extensive therapy.</p><p>Due to difficulties from an intestinal blockage, Squier passed away on November 15, 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ken-squier-wife-who-did-he-marry><strong>Ken Squier Wife: Who Did He Marry?</strong></h2><p>We know Ken Squier’s age at the time he died—88—but who was his wife? Who did the sportscaster marry?</p><p>Elizabeth Thompson was Ken Squier’s wife. In Stowe, Virginia, the pair lived together when Ken was alive.</p><p>Their union has consistently provided unity and support during both easy and difficult times. In addition to his racing career, Ken and Elizabeth co-manage a sheep farm in Vermont, which highlights their common passions and pursuits.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ken-squier-children><strong>Ken Squier Children</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-2023-11-16T182430.410.png><p>There isn’t any information on how many kids Ken Squier and his wife have online at the moment. In social media posts and media appearances, Ken Squier remained discreet about both his personal and professional lives.</p><p>As a result, the precise number of children that Ken Squier and his wife have is still unknown. Wherever Ken Squier’s children are, they must be grieving at the moment, but we cannot confirm if he had any children with his wife.</p><p>At this moment, we know what Ken Squier’s age was when he died. We also know about his wife, and there are no details about his children, but what is Ken Squier’s net worth? How much was he worth before his sad death?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ken-squier-net-worth-how-much-was-he-worth><strong>Ken Squier Net Worth: How Much Was He Worth?</strong></h2><p>Ken Squier’s estimated net worth as of 2023 is $7 million. Squier’s financial situation is proof of his long-lasting contributions to the game, which span decades of involvement in different roles in the broadcasting and racing businesses.</p><p>His fortune is a reflection of his accomplishments in the workplace and his enduring influence on the motorsports industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ken-squier-height-how-tall-was-he><strong>Ken Squier Height: How Tall Was He?</strong></h2><p>For the work that he did before his passing, height may not be the most important thing, but people want to know what Ken Squier’s height was.</p><p>Ken Squier is 5 ft 5 in (165.1 cm) tall.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC3xKdkrKmlnrKzecCgnGavmZuybrrErWSwp6KptW6vx6KjnaqVo3qpscign61n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fken-squier-age-wife-net-worth-children-height.html&text=Ken%20Squier%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2c%20Height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fken-squier-age-wife-net-worth-children-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fken-squier-age-wife-net-worth-children-height.html&title=Ken%20Squier%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fken-squier-age-wife-net-worth-children-height.html&title=Ken%20Squier%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fken-squier-age-wife-net-worth-children-height.html&title=Ken%20Squier%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fken-squier-age-wife-net-worth-children-height.html&description=Ken%20Squier%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paul-williams-net-worth-274916.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paul Williams Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kaemor-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-623805-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaemor Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
