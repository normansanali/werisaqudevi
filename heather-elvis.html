Heather Elvis has been missing for almost seven years. The two people Tammy and Sidney Moorer have been identified as suspects in Heather’s abduction.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>Heather was born in the United States on<strong> June 30, 1993.</strong> Her nationality is American, but her race is uncertain.&nbsp;Debbie Elvis and Terry Elvis have an older daughter named Elvis. Morgan Elvis, her younger sister, is her only sibling. In Heather’s honor, her sister has a tattoo that reads “Never Give Up.”</p><p>In terms of her education, she attended St. James High School in Murrells Inlet, where she received her diploma in 2011. She was also practicing Cosmetology at the time of her abduction.</p><h2><span id=Heather_Elvis_8211_Professional_Life>Heather Elvis – Professional Life</span></h2><p>Heather moved to Carolina Forest after graduation to pursue her education and interests. She shared a room with Bri Warrelmann in the Carolina Forest. She supported herself by working as a hostess at the Tilted Kilt in Myrtle Beach and the House of Blues in North Myrtle Beach.</p><p>At that moment, Elvis encountered Sidney Moorer, a Tilted restaurant maintenance worker who fixed the kitchen appliances. When serving in the restaurant in 2013, the two fell in love right away. Moorer’s wife Tammy Moorer approached Elvis and Moorer after they had been dating for three months.</p><p>Tammy sent Elvis several confrontational text messages after learning about her husband’s affair, intimidating her physically. Elvis and Moorer ended their relationship in September 2013. “Once upon a time, an angel and a demon fall in love,” Elvis also tweeted. It didn’t go well.”</p><h2><span id=Disappearance>Disappearance</span></h2><p>Heather worked at a beauty parlor in downtown Myrtle Beach at the time. On the night of December 17, 2013, the day Elvis vanished, she went out on a date with Steven Schiraldi.</p><p>Steven had also shown her how to drive a car in the Inlet Square Mall parking lot, and Elvis had sent pictures to her father and Warrelman. Schiraldi dropped Elvis off at her Carolina Forest apartment around 1:15 a.m.</p><p>He was the last guy Elvis saw on that very day. Her phone was deactivated around 6 a.m. after that, and she hasn’t been seen again.</p><p>Heather Elvis’s sedan, a green Dodge Intrepid, was discovered on the evening of December 19, 2013. It was approximately 8 miles (13 kilometers) from her apartment at the Peachtree Landing boat launch along the Waccamaw River in Socastee.</p><p>When the car was unlocked, nothing was found, including her cell, keys, and purse.</p><h2><span id=Heather_Elvis_8211_Suspects>Heather Elvis – Suspects</span></h2><p>According to the investigations, Sidney Moorer and his wife were two individuals who were suspicious of Elvis’ disappearances. Heather Elvis was kidnapped in 2014, and a jury in Horry County held them guilty.</p><p>The pair are even sentenced to 30 years in jail, but they have yet to share more information of the abduction, murder, or where the body was found, and they continue to uphold their innocence.</p><p>Heather Elvis had spoken to Sidney for the final time hours before she vanished. Elvis was also discovered to be pregnant, having received a maternity kit the night she went missing.</p><p>In a video taken days after Heather went missing, Sidney can be seen happily cleaning the accused truck with his mom. Similarly, his car, a black F-150, was caught on tape driving to Peachtree Landing, where Elvis was last seen, according to mobile trace.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Heather Elvis was 20 years old at the time she vanished. There is no specific information about her appearance, whether she is alive or dead, available at this time.</p><p>On the anniversary of Elvis’ disappearance, people assemble at Peachtree Landing in Myrtle Beach, S.C. for a vigil for Heather Elvis. Her family had donated funds to help restore Peachtree Landing’s community garden. She enjoys being in front of the camera and applying lipstick, according to her nearest family members.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurement>Body Measurement</span></h2><p>Heather Elvis was <strong>5 foot 11 inches</strong> or 155 cm tall, though she is of medium height and weight. Her eyes are a stunning dark brown color, and her hair is brown.</p><h3 class=normal>More Makeup Artist</h3><h3 class=normal>Heather Elvis Fans Also Viewed</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmieoprAqbHRqaasrF6YvK57x56YraCVp3qmuNWiqmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheather-elvis.html&text=Heather%20Elvis%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheather-elvis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheather-elvis.html&title=Heather%20Elvis%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheather-elvis.html&title=Heather%20Elvis%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheather-elvis.html&title=Heather%20Elvis%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheather-elvis.html&description=Heather%20Elvis%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./myanna-buring-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MyAnna Buring Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./intel-xeon-e5-2687w-v3-and-e5-2650-v3-review-haswell-ep-with-10-cores.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gaming Benchmarks - Intel Xeon E5-2687W v3 and E5-2650 v3 Review: Haswell-EP with 10 Cores">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
