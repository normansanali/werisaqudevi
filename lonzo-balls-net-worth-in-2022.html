The Ball brothers made headlines as they played together on teams where their father LaVar served as the coach. All three eventually went on to suit up for Chino Hills High School, where they continued to shine with viral highlight plays. During his senior year, Lonzo received several national honors for averaging a triple-double and leading his team to an undefeated record and state title. By the time he pursued his collegiate career, everyone’s eyes were on the consensus five-star recruit as he committed to play for the UCLA Bruins.</p><p>Ball continued to be on everyone’s radar as he led the Bruins from a 15-17 season to a 31-5 record by turning them into the nation’s top-scoring team. The California native continued to impress with his exceptional vision and passing, even to the point of gathering multiple NBA executives watch his games, particularly his matchup against then-fellow top prospect Markelle Fultz.</p><p>After his lone and heavily awarded 2016-17 season with UCLA, Ball declared for the draft as a highly touted recruit accompanied by both hype and promise. He went on to join the Los Angeles Lakers as the 2017 draft’s second overall pick, headlining a young core alongside Brandon Ingram and replacing the recently traded D’Angelo Russell as their new starting point guard.</p><p>The former Bruin survived a rocky debut season with All-Rookie Second-Team honors. Despite being riddled with injuries and shooting struggles, Ball showed flashes of his signature passing skills, recording multiple triple-doubles within his first 20 games.</p><p>The following season, the Purple and Gold franchise signed four-time MVP LeBron James, their biggest player yet since the late Kobe Bryant retired. As a result, Ball went through several changes in his sophomore year. Although Ball’s added bulk notably turned him into a dynamic defensive presence, he also had to adjust his playing style to complement James. Unfortunately, he was once again riddled with the injury bug, eventually being sidelined after an ankle injury.</p><p>In the quest for building a championship team, the Lakers traded most of their young core to the New Orleans Pelicans during the following offseason. In exchange, they were able to add immediate star power with big man Anthony Davis. What was initially painted by many as another obstacle for the eldest Ball brother turned into a blessing.</p><p>During his stint with the Pelicans, Lonzo reworked his infamously wacky shooting form and got used to yet another role as a 3-and-D player. There, he recorded several new career highs including 33 points, eight 3-pointers, a 41.4% field goal percentage, and 37.8% shooting from beyond the arc. After two seasons, Ball moved to the Chicago Bulls through a sign-and-trade deal.</p><p>Prior to his injury, the former second overall pick posted the best numbers as a fifth-year player, with career-high averages of 34.6 minutes, 42.3% both in field goal and 3-point field goal shooting, 1.8 steals, and 0.9 blocks. In a lineup that included All-Stars and offensive juggernauts DeMar DeRozan, Zach Lavine, and Nikola Vucevic, Ball also put up a respectable 13.0 points per game.</p><p>Off the court, Ball has expressed his fondness for rap music, even releasing a rap album and several singles. He was a star of Ball in the Family along with the rest of the Ball family. He also previously endorsed his father’s apparel company Big Baller Brand, with whom he released his first shoe called the ZO2. However, he later cut ties with the brand after accusations that BBB co-founder Alan Foster stole from business and personal finances.</p><p>Fortunately, money won’t seem to be a problem. In his relatively young career, <a href=#>Spotrac</a> reports that the four-year guard already has an estimated $51.5 million in career earnings as of the 2021-22 season. That $80 million contract will certainly help him out, and he will hopefully come back stronger than ever from this knee injury to help the Bulls into the future as they try to become a championship contender.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Were you at all stunned by&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Lonzo Ball&#39;s net worth in 2022"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":5059,"3":{"1":0},"4":{"1":3,"3":2},"9":1,"10":2,"11":3,"12":0,"15":"arial, sans, sans-serif"}'>Lonzo Ball's net worth in 2022?</span></span><b></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnKrBpLTPqKCnrKNjsLC5jqWmp7KfYq%2BiuMusZKedpGLEsL7ToWSipl1nfXN%2B</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flonzo-balls-net-worth-in-2022.html&text=Lonzo%20Ball%27s%20net%20worth%20in%202022&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flonzo-balls-net-worth-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flonzo-balls-net-worth-in-2022.html&title=Lonzo%20Ball%27s%20net%20worth%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flonzo-balls-net-worth-in-2022.html&title=Lonzo%20Ball%27s%20net%20worth%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flonzo-balls-net-worth-in-2022.html&title=Lonzo%20Ball%27s%20net%20worth%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flonzo-balls-net-worth-in-2022.html&description=Lonzo%20Ball%27s%20net%20worth%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lori-beth-denberg-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lori Beth Denberg Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kenny-demens.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kenny Demens Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
