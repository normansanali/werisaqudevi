When Brian was born to Kathy and Joe in Louisville, Kentucky, he brought much joy to their hearts and surprised their older children, Joey and Penny.&nbsp;Brian’s unwavering love and commitment to his family will always be remembered as his greatest legacy.</p><p>His life was filled with enormous delight by his nephews Tyler and Cole, and he left behind his treasured mother, Kathy, and beloved sister, Penny (Rich). Brian is reunited with his late father Joe and late brother Joey in the afterlife; both men were instrumental in developing the extraordinary person we honor today. In addition, he is reunited with his beloved extended family members, including his grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p><p>After finishing high school at Saint Xavier in 2004, Brian attended Western Kentucky University (WKU), where he majored in political science and English and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 2008. It seemed virtually inevitable that Brian would go to law school given his inherent talent for persuasion. He graduated with honors in 2013 from the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law and went on to earn his Kentucky bar certification shortly after.</p><p>In 2017, driven by a desire to use his legal training to help victims of workplace discrimination and other forms of civil rights abuse, Brian opened his own law firm called Abell Attorneys. His tireless representation of tenants’ rights in eviction cases was recognized by the Legal Aid Society.&nbsp;Outside of the law, Brian’s other passion was exploring the outdoors. Brian did all he could to experience life to the fullest, from completing half marathons and climbing trails to playing golf and drinking rare bourbons.</p><p>He loved spending time with his nephews and appreciated the memories they helped him make.&nbsp;Brian’s brilliance will remain in our hearts forever, serving as a constant reminder to cherish the time we spend with those we love. The family would appreciate it if, in lieu of flowers, memorial contributions might be donated to Little Sisters of the Poor, an organization near and dear to Brian’s heart.&nbsp;Have a peaceful rest, Brian. Your legacy will bring us endless happiness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZK%2BztcCnZJqalaG5brvBoquumaKueq271KKqr6GcobJut9hmmK2sn6e7psWMoZisZaOWsa3FjKmYrKuVmXqiw8CyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrian-abell-obituary-louisville-ky-attorney-has-sadly-passed-away.html&text=Brian%20Abell%20Obituary%2c%20Louisville%20KY%2c%20Attorney%20Has%20Sadly%20Passed%20Away&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrian-abell-obituary-louisville-ky-attorney-has-sadly-passed-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-abell-obituary-louisville-ky-attorney-has-sadly-passed-away.html&title=Brian%20Abell%20Obituary%2c%20Louisville%20KY%2c%20Attorney%20Has%20Sadly%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrian-abell-obituary-louisville-ky-attorney-has-sadly-passed-away.html&title=Brian%20Abell%20Obituary%2c%20Louisville%20KY%2c%20Attorney%20Has%20Sadly%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-abell-obituary-louisville-ky-attorney-has-sadly-passed-away.html&title=Brian%20Abell%20Obituary%2c%20Louisville%20KY%2c%20Attorney%20Has%20Sadly%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrian-abell-obituary-louisville-ky-attorney-has-sadly-passed-away.html&description=Brian%20Abell%20Obituary%2c%20Louisville%20KY%2c%20Attorney%20Has%20Sadly%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./britney-spears-brings-niece-maddie-sons-to-disney-world-w471999.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britney Spears Brings Niece Maddie, Sons to Disney World">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./braylon-hall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Braylon Hall Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
