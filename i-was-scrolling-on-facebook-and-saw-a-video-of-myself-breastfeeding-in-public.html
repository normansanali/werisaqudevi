I can’t imagine how you felt, I’m so sorry,” posted a fellow mom.</p><p>Then this person pointed out that the beach was a pretty normal place for people to wear little clothing anyway.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Isabel concludes the video by saying “Next time you see a mom breastfeeding her child in public, covered up or not, tell her how good of a job she’s doing.” <span class=credit>TikTok/izlomax</span></figure><p>“She’s at the beach… Most times people go half-naked with thongs or tiny tops. The woman can simply tell her son that babies eat that way or with a bottle…” they said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Complaining about nakedness AT A BEACH is insane anyways.
