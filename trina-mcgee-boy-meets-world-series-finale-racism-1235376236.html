I was told, in kind of a weird, off-handed way by a very important person, that you guys all went to [showrunner] Michael Jacobs, and you said, ‘We don’t want her in the last episode. She’s somehow taking our light.’ [That] was the gist of it,” said McGee, who played Shawn Hunter’s (Rider Strong) girlfriend on the show. “I was told that after I shot what was the show before the last episode, which was called ‘Angela’s Ashes’ when I left. When Michael announced to me, we’re going to do another show on Angela, I was so happy, not knowing this was going to be the show before the last show.”</p><h2 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-050 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/featured_game_remakes.jpg alt="Illustration of a video game controller surrounded by a recycle icon" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="c-span lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase u-font-family-basic lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-padding-b-075 lrv-u-font-size-12 u-font-size-13@tablet u-color-brand-vip-primary"><a href=# class="c-span__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">VIP+</a></span><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">‘Until Dawn,’ ‘Silent Hill 2’ Remakes Show Relevancy of Retreading IP</a></h3><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/the-fire-inside_still_hero.jpg alt="The Fire Inside" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">'The Fire Inside' Review: Ryan Destiny Gives a Powerfully Gritty Performance in a True-Life Boxing Drama That's Like 'Girlfight' Meets 'Air'</a></h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Co-hosts Strong, <a href=# id=auto-tag_danielle-fishel_1 data-tag=danielle-fishel>Danielle Fishel</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_will-friedle_1 data-tag=will-friedle>Will Friedle</a> were shocked and appalled over that claim — and felt awful that she was told that 22 years ago.</p><h3>Popular on Variety</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I remember after we taped the show, I had said to a person, ‘Why aren’t we on the last show?’ Because I know the last show was going to be the one with the ratings and the crying and all the stuff. I was under the impression that y’all got together and did not want me in the last show, for some reason I was going to take some shine or something to that effect,” she continued. “That was really hurtful to me for a long time. To make it worse, people of color tend to look into things a little harder sometimes. So I had cousins calling me, saying, ‘How come you weren’t in the last episode? They just gave you that whole show so that you’d be distracted and wouldn’t be in the show with the real ratings?’ Several of my cousins, my family members were telling me this… I have honestly had that in my head for 20 years.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Friedle was not happy about the claim. “Can we say for the record, Trina, that never happened,” he said. “That’s not competitiveness, that’s sociopathy. This pisses me off. This is next level.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">McGee kindly replied, “I believe you. I can tell by your reactions. I have had that in my head for so long, and I’ve never watched that show. I’ve always felt like, ugh… That hurt me a long time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While Fishel and McGee remembered being pitted against each other, the men said that it wasn’t the same for them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s true that we weren’t played against each other, but I won’t go so far to say we weren’t manipulated,” Strong said. Friedle responded, “Oh no, that’s different. Manipulated all the time. But it wasn’t whispering in one ear, whispering in another ear about something else.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/featured_game_remakes.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">During the episode, McGee also looked back at an op-ed that she wrote for the Daily News, in which she defended the fact that “Boy Meets World” didn’t address that Shawn and Angela were in an interracial relationship. She shared on the podcast that her publicist and husband actually wrote the piece, which was published under her byline, but that she didn’t agree.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was very confused at the time about whether to talk about it or not —&nbsp;I had two realms of thinking: my job and mankind,” she said. “It wasn’t totally my organic view. Funny enough, a rebuttal was written to the Daily News by Lorraine Toussaint, who said, ‘No, you must acknowledge that these are two different races getting together…’ If I had to do it over and I could take my real stance — hindsight and everything — I would have wrote the opposite article.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Strong also remembered talking to McGee about the topic, also wondering why they weren’t discussing it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Before the family sitcom, McGee had starred on multiple sitcoms with Black casts, including “A Different World,” “Martin” and “Family Matters.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Coming from Black sitcoms, I always had to have like a Black meter… My Black meter was probably down to a 2. I remember when I was doing ‘Angela’s Ashes’ episode, somehow my Black meter had slipped up and I was at about a 9. Michael came over to me and his note was, ‘Hey Trina, just turn down the Telma Hopkins about eight notches,'” she said, noting that the producer was referencing the Black “Family Matters” actor. “I knew exactly what he was talking about and I did. … There are so many things you guys are so lucky you didn’t have to think about.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Years ago, McGee and Friedle shared an interaction they had on set that he says completely changed his life. They recounted the conversation on the podcast, noting that on set, McGee came out of the dressing room in a red headscarf.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“In my head, I attached no cultural significance to that whatsoever. I saw a person who I thought was my friend but didn’t know very well, wearing a big, red hat. That’s all I saw,” Friedle explained. “I was like, ‘You’re part of the cast, so that means, I’m gonna make fun of you the same way I make fun [of others].’ I thought, ‘Gonna make fun of her red hat.’ That’s as far as my dumbass, privileged mind saw. So right before I walked on for my part, I walked by and went, ‘Love your syrup,’ and walked on to the set, thinking ‘Boom, zing! Just got her for her hat.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After the scene, McGee told Friedle his comment referring to her as Aunt Jemima was not okay.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I remember saying to you, ‘I assumed that was like you calling me the jolly green giant.’ You were like, ‘No, that’s not the same thing at all.'” Friedle said. “Never use the time as an excuse but the mid-90s, I had no idea of the cultural significance of the Aunt Jemima character, any of that stuff… I had never heard that! I was mortified.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After she explained the offensive comment to him, he apologized and they hugged — but he was “literally shaking” afterward. McGee recalled feeling “very small,” to which Friedle responded, “How could you not?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It literally changed my life,” he continued. “That moment was the moment where I was like, you can’t just say stuff. You can’t throw stuff out there, because you think it’s funny and walk away. You could be hurting people.”</p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap lrv-a-font-primary-s o-nav__title a-content-ignore lrv-u-margin-r-050">Read More About:</h4><ul
