Although as per Fowler, Rhule was hired because of his ability to rebuild programs quickly at Temple and Baylor.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Matt Rhule LSU</h2><p>A new potential candidate for the LSU head coaching position emerged.

Another name to add to the list of candidates. Right now, Mel Tucker, Lane Kiffin, Luke Fickell, and James Franklin are the highlighted names LSU may be looking at according to media reports.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Rhule was to be another strong addition to that list.
